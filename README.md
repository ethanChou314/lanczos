This Python module provides tools for performing Lanczos iterations. It includes a high-level function to expand the Krylov subspace until the desired eigenvalues have converged.

FeaturesLanczos Iteration: Efficiently generates a Krylov subspace and reduces a symmetric matrix to tridiagonal form.Re-orthogonalization: Uses a double-pass modified Gram-Schmidt process to prevent the "ghost eigenvalues" caused by loss of orthogonality in floating-point arithmetic.Convergence Monitoring: Iteratively increases the subspace size $m$ until the requested $k$ eigenvalues stabilize.Multiple Selection Modes: Find eigenvalues based on:smallest or largest algebraic value.smallest abs or largest abs magnitude.arbitrary (the first $k$ found).
